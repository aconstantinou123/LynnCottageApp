  <Accordion.Body>
    East Linton is a picturesque country village located between Haddington and Dunbar. The village is situated on the River Tyne, 22 miles east of Edinburgh. It's one of the prettiest villages in East Lothian, steeped in history and surrounded by some of the oldest buildings in Scotland. It remains a vibrant community with great shops, a couple of good pubs, beautiful countryside, and good transport links to surrounding towns and Edinburgh.
  </Accordion.Body>
  <Accordion.Body>
    A bridge was built over the River Tyne during the 16th Century, making East Linton a staging post on the Great Northern Road between Edinburgh and London. The village developed over the years due to its location and the name Linton is most probably derived from the village waterfall, the Linn (or Lynn).
  </Accordion.Body>
  <Accordion.Body>
    The centre point of the village is the distinctive fountain with its four cherubs, built in 1882 and recently refurbished. Behind the fountain is St Andrew's Church, now a place of residence. The large clock in the tower known locally as <b>Auld Jessie</b> was installed to commemorate Queen Victoria's Jubilee and is kept in fine working order.
  </Accordion.Body>
  <Accordion.Body>
    At one time the village was full of working mills which were powered by the River Tyne, these included linen and flour mills, plus a distillery. <b>Preston Mill</b> which was one of these mills was built around 1599 and is one of the main historical attractions, featuring in recent times in the American hit TV series <b>Outlander</b> (visitors can still see working machinery on a tour during the summer months). <b>Phantassie Doo'cot</b>, nearby is a beehive shaped dovecot from the 16th century.
  </Accordion.Body>
  <Accordion.Body>
    East Linton also had its own <b>livestock market</b>, a distinctive octagonal building which can still be seen today if you visit The Mart to buy your groceries or attend the regular weekend Craft Market.
  </Accordion.Body>
  <Accordion.Body>
    The remaining working parish church, <b>Prestonkirk</b> was built in the 18th Century but retains its original chancery dating from the 13th century. One of the graves in the church yard belongs to Andrew Meikle who was the inventor of the threshing machine.
  </Accordion.Body>
  <Accordion.Body>
    Another famous Lintonian was John Rennie, the civil engineer who was born at Phantassie in 1761. John started working as a millwright with Andrew Meikle then studied at Edinburgh University. In 1791 he moved to London and is most famous for building Waterloo Bridge and London Bridge.
  </Accordion.Body>
  <Accordion.Body>
    East Linton has a long tradition of landscape painting. In the later 19th century East Linton produced several artists of renown known as the <b>East Linton School</b>.

    <h4>Dunbar Harbour, Castle & Battery</h4>
    All that remains is the weathered fragmented ruin of what was once one of the mightiest castles in Scotland. You can't access the ruins themselves due the precarious state but the best view is from just below the leisure centre.The much better preserved battery lies at the north-east corner of the Victoria Harbour. This once protected the entrance to the old Dunbar Harbour and now provides a good viewpoint for the town, harbours, and castle. It's a short walk from here to the town's main street with it's shops and cafes.
